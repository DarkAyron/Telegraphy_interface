Telegrapy interface
-------------------

An interface between computers an telegraphy hardware like morse key,
telegraph sounder and radio transmitter.

Before you compile this, please edit src/defines.h and define your call sign!

During compilation a device key will be generated. It'll be stored as
anubis_key.bin. Be careful, this key grants access to your telegraphy interface.

At the moment, the hardware is just a tinkering on a bread board.
Schematic and PCB-layout will follow.
